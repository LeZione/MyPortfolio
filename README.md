Hi! 

I am currently rebuilding the portfolio that I created when I was in 2nd year college as I wanted to get back on track to relearning programming.
This repository serves as my backup for the programs that I am creating for my portolio, it also is for vercel which hosts the portfolio website.

I'm mainly creating this portfolio website with the use of PHP. Let's see in the future what else is in store while I continue developing this portfolio
of mine.

Keep on coding! Yes I am talking to you self!
